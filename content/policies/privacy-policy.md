# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 1, 2025**

## Introduction

Welcome to ViramQ. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights when interacting with the ViramQ platform.

## About ViramQ

ViramQ is a website that displays slokas (devotional verses) in multiple languages for users to read and explore. ViramQ does **not** require users to register, create accounts, or provide any personal information to access the site’s main features.

## Information We Collect

### Language Preference

ViramQ stores your language preference to provide content in your chosen language when you revisit the site. The details are:

- **Local Storage:** Your selected language code (such as "en", "hi", or "te") is stored in your browser's local storage.
- **Cookie:** A cookie named `i18n_redirected` is set by our internationalization system to remember your last language choice.

This information is stored exclusively on your device. It is **never transmitted to ViramQ servers or shared with third parties**.

### Technical Information

When you visit ViramQ, your browser transmits standard technical information required for website delivery, such as:

- Browser type and version
- Device type and operating system
- IP address (required for network communication)
- Visited URLs (pages on ViramQ you visit)

ViramQ does **not** use this technical information for analytics, advertising, or user tracking. We do **not** build user profiles or monitor user journeys across the site.

## How We Use Your Information

ViramQ uses the information described above only for the following purposes:

- To display slokas in your selected language
- To maintain the technical functioning of the website
- To remember your language preference on future visits

We do **not**:

- Collect, process, or analyze personal or sensitive information
- Use tracking or analytics tools (such as Google Analytics)
- Send any marketing communications
- Share data with advertisers or third parties

## Cookies and Local Storage

Cookies and browser local storage are used solely for essential website operation—specifically, to save your language preference. If you disable or clear cookies/local storage in your browser, your preference will not be remembered and you will have to reselect your language each visit.

## Third-Party Services

ViramQ may link to external sites (e.g., to resources, references, or community platforms), but does not use third-party services (like social media widgets or analytics) that collect user data. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party websites. Please refer to their privacy policies if you visit those sites.

## Data Security

ViramQ does not store user data on its servers. All preference data remains on your device. While we take reasonable steps to ensure technical security of the site, no system is 100% secure due to the nature of the internet.

## Your Rights

You have the following rights when using ViramQ:

- You can clear your local storage and cookies at any time, which will remove your language selection.
- You can change your language selection as often as you wish.
- You can use ViramQ without storing settings, but the language selection will not persist.

Because we do **not** collect personal information, there is no personal data to request, download, or delete from our servers.

## Children's Privacy

ViramQ is designed for audiences of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children or from any visitors.

## Policy Updates

We may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our practices or for legal reasons. The current version will always be available on this page with its "Last Updated" date.
