# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: 7th December 2025**

## Introduction

Welcome to ViramQ. Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have when using ViramQ.

## About ViramQ

ViramQ is more than just a break reminder—it’s a companion for digital well-being. Inspired by the Sanskrit word "Virama" (विराम), meaning pause or rest, and combined with "Q" for cue or reminder, ViramQ helps you build healthier habits through mindful breaks and timely reminders. With ViramQ, you can set intervals for breaks, hydration, and breathing, or follow guided suggestions for relaxation and meditation. You remain in control: ViramQ does **not** require you to register, create accounts, or share personal information to access its features.

## Information We Collect

### Language and Preference Data

To deliver reminders and content in your chosen language or settings, ViramQ stores minimal preferences on your device:

- **Local Storage:** Your reminder settings (such as chosen break intervals), and feature preferences are saved in your device's local storage.

These preferences are stored **only** on your device. They are **never** transmitted to ViramQ servers or external parties.


## How We Use Your Information

ViramQ uses your local information for the following purposes **only**:

- Display content, reminders, and features in your selected language and preferences
- Support the technical functioning of the website and app
- Remember your language and break preferences for your next visit

We do **not**:

- Collect, process, or analyze personal or sensitive data
- Use analytics, marketing trackers, or advertising tools
- Send marketing communications
- Share data with third parties or advertisers


## Third-Party Services

ViramQ may include links to external resources for your benefit (such as wellness guides or community platforms). However, we do **not** embed third-party services (like social media widgets or analytics) that could collect or process your data. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of linked external sites; please review their privacy policies if you follow those links.

## Data Security

ViramQ does not store your preference data on our servers. All reminder settings and personal preferences stay on your device. While we take reasonable steps to ensure the technical security of ViramQ, please be aware that no online service can be 100% secure.

## Your Rights

When using ViramQ, you have complete control over your preferences:

- You may clear your local storage and cookies at any time, erasing your language and reminder settings.
- You may adjust or disable your break and notification preferences as often as you wish.
- You can use ViramQ without storing any settings, but preferences such as language and intervals will not persist between visits.

Since we do **not** collect or retain personal information, there is no personal data to request, download, or delete from ViramQ.

## Children’s Privacy

ViramQ is suitable for all ages and does not knowingly collect personal information from children or any users.

## Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy as features evolve or for legal compliance. The latest version will always be available on this page with its "Last Updated" date.
